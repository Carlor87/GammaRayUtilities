# GammaRayUtilities
Set of scripts and small libraries developed for data analysis in gamma ray astrophysics

This repository has the purpose of collecting some of the scripts and small libraries I have developed during these years as a PhD student in gamma ray astrophysics. The language I used was Python (mostly python2).

The material (of different nature) is divided in various self-contained folders that are described below (this file will be updated together with the folders I will upload)

# 1- EBL
Folder with a small class that computes the absorption (and the deabsorption) of the flux of a gamma ray source due to the effect of the extragalactic background light (EBL). The class (for the moment, I could add more models with time) allows to choose between the model developed by Franceschini et al. (2008) and the model developed by Dominguez (2011).
